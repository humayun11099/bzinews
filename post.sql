Jang had called the police in South Korea\'s capital Seoul after not being able to reach Jun-an on his mobile phone for days.\r\n\r\nWhen they forced open his brother\'s door, Jang found Jun-an lying lifeless on the bed. \"I never thought my brother would take his own life,\" he says.\r\n\r\nThis was despite Jun-an having tried to kill himself five years earlier, in 2013 - Jang thought he\'d been happier since then after receiving treatment in a psychiatric clinic.\r\n\r\n\"It couldn\'t have been perfect,\" says Jang, \"but we thought he was finding his way back into the world. He didn\'t show any signs of suffering. I think he didn\'t want to be a burden to the family.\"\r\n\r\nIt is still really hard for Jang to talk openly about what his family has gone through because suicide is such a sensitive issue in South Korea. Earlier this year it announced new plans to try to bring down its suicide rates - some of the highest in the world.\r\n\r\nSouth Korea is famous for K-pop and global companies like Samsung. But in this outwardly successful society, on average more than 35 people take their own lives every day and suicide is the leading cause of death among those aged 10 to 39.\r\n\r\nJang, 46, is doing his best to raise awareness by sharing his personal journey. At the time he found Jun-an\'s body he\'d actually been taking a course to become a suicide prevention instructor.\r\n\r\n\"I visited schools to educate children about the common signs of a person thinking about suicide and what can be done to help them. I tried to save other people\'s lives.\"\r\n\r\nFamily\'s \'only hope\'\r\nJang had long thought of getting this training because his family had a high risk of suicide. He hoped they\'d made it through their struggles and wanted to give something back to society.\r\n\r\nJang and Jun-an\'s family went through a particularly difficult time in 2010, when South Korea severed all economic ties with the North. This was after the sinking of the warship Cheonan, which killed 46 sailors.\r\n\r\nHis father ran one of the few companies that did business with the North - and the sudden termination of relations led to the business going bankrupt.\r\n\r\nA family photo of Jang and his brother Jun-an as children\r\nIMAGE SOURCE,JANG JUN-HA\r\nImage caption,\r\nJang says he and his brother Jun-an shared many traits\r\nThe family had to separate and live in different places. The business his father ran failed and Jun-an became \"our only hope\", says Jang, recalling the pressure put on his brother.\r\n\r\nJun-an had done well at school and planned to study abroad, but the family could no longer support him.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Jun-an\'s suicide attempt in 2013, Jang was still busy paying off his family\'s debts and was trying to become a qualified counsellor while doing his day job.\r\n\r\nIt was only after Jun-an\'s death five years later that Jang asked to see his brother\'s medical records - and found out he had been going to therapy every week for nearly a decade.\r\n\r\n\"Like many other Korean families, he was under great pressure to succeed.

Their third bout of Covid was significantly worse than the previous time they caught it.\r\n\r\n\"I thought every time you catch an illness it\'s supposed to be a bit better each time?\" was the message from his sickbed.\r\n\r\nThat has certainly been said a lot during the pandemic. But I also know work colleagues and people I have interviewed or chatted to at the school gates, who have been hit hard by Covid in the past few months.\r\n\r\nA familiar tale has been a week of coughing, headaches or fever followed by a lingering fatigue.\r\n\r\nIt is important to stress that Covid has always caused a wide range of symptoms. Even before vaccines, some lucky people barely got sick or did not even develop symptoms.\r\n\r\nFor some of us, Covid is just a sniffle - not even enough to make you go digging around in the bathroom cabinet to see if there is a lateral flow test hiding in there.\r\n\r\nBut scientists specialising in our immune system warn Covid is still causing stonking infections that may be worse than before and knock us out for weeks.\r\n\r\nSo what is going on?\r\n\r\nHow we fare after being exposed to Covid comes down to the battle between the virus itself and our body\'s defences.\r\n\r\nThe earliest stages are crucial as they dictate how much of a foothold the virus gets inside our body, and how severe it is going to be.\r\n\r\nHowever, waning immunity and the virus evolving are tipping the scales.\r\n\r\n\'Feel pretty rough\'\r\nProf Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh, has had her own \"horrid\" bout of Covid that was \"much worse\" than expected.\r\n\r\nShe told me: \"People\'s antibody levels against Covid are probably as low now as they have been since the vaccine was first introduced.\"\r\n\r\nAntibodies are like microscopic missiles that stick to the surface of the virus and stop it from infecting our body\'s cells.\r\n\r\nSo, if you have lots of antibodies, they can mop up the virus quickly and any infection will hopefully be short and mild.\r\n\r\n\"Now, because antibodies are lower, a higher dose [of the virus] is getting through and causing a more severe bout of disease,\" Prof Riley says.\r\n\r\nAntibody levels are relatively low because it has been a long time since many of us were vaccinated (if you are young and healthy you were only ever offered two doses and a booster) or infected, which also tops up immunity.\r\n\r\nProf Peter Openshaw, from Imperial College London, told me: \"The thing that made the huge difference before was the very wide and fast rollout of vaccines - even young adults managed to get vaccinated, and that made an absolutely huge difference.\"\r\n\r\n', 'Dec 23, 2023', '1703347891658706b36e361.jpg', '6', '3', 'Active');

The new draft rules have not veered from regulators\' ongoing focus on ensuring companies have \"reasonable business models and operating cadence\", he said.\r\n\r\nHe added that minors have been spending a historically low level of money and time on Tencent\'s games since 2021 when protection of younger players became a focus for Beijing.\r\n\r\nShares in rival NetEase - which has not commented yet on the proposals - were down more than 24%.\r\n\r\nShares of Dutch tech investor Prosus lost more than 14%. Prosus\'s stock performance is closely linked to that of Tencent - which is its biggest investment in a wide-ranging portfolio of technology stocks.\r\n\r\nThe shockwaves were felt throughout Hong Kong\'s Hang Seng Index, which dropped more than 4% at one point, and was down 1.7% by the close of trade.\r\n\r\nGaming consultant Daniel Camilo told the BBC that both Tencent and NetEase have a lot of free to play games that are \"pay to win\" where gamers are \"actively incentivised to spend money on their games\".\r\n\r\nThe restrictions could affect those types of \"monetisation models\" which would then have to be restructured and \"some of the games might actually have to be pulled out from the stores,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr Camilo thought that both Tencent or NetEase would recover in the long run. However, the same cannot be said for smaller gaming companies.\r\n\r\n\"If a small company is affected in a few millions, then it might mean that they have to close their doors,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"2023 has been a year full of layoffs and a lot of struggle in particular for the gaming industry in China. So this is kind of a severe blow I would say, especially for the medium and smaller publishers.\"\r\n\r\nThe government\'s new gaming rules would also potentially speed up the process of giving games the green light in the country by requiring regulators to process approvals within 60 days.\r\n\r\nGame publishers would need to house their servers processing and storing user data in China, rather than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAccording to Reuters, the administration is seeking public comment on the proposals by 22 January.', 'Dec 23, 2023', '17033480436587074b85a0f.jpg', '4', '3', 'Active');

INSERT INTO `post` VALUES ('9', 'AI cannot patent inventions, UK Supreme Court confirms', 'ai-cannot-patent-inventions-uk-supreme-court-confirms', 'The UK Supreme Court has upheld earlier decisions in rejecting a bid to allow an artificial intelligence to be named as an inventor in a patent application.\r\n\r\nTechnologist Dr Stephen Thaler had sought to have his AI, called Dabus, recognised as the inventor of a food container and a flashing light beacon.\r\n\r\nBut in 2019, the intellectual property office (IPO) rejected this, saying only a person could be named as an inventor.\r\n\r\nThe decision was then backed by both the High Court and Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\nThe IPO has argued, and courts have supported the view, that only \"persons\" can have patent rights, not AIs.\r\n\r\nNow five Supreme Court judges have dismissed a bid to reverse those decisions, concluding that \"an inventor must be a person\", and that an AI cannot be named as an inventor to secure patent rights.\r\n\r\nThe judgement does not deal with the issue of whether Dabus did in fact invent the food container and light.\r\n\r\nDr Thaler, who believes that Dabus is a \"conscious and sentient form of machine intelligence\", told the BBC \"Naturally, I feel disappointed by this decision, highlighting the ongoing clash between human and machine intelligence.\"\r\n\r\nThe IPO told the BBC it welcomed the judgement and the clarification it provided.\r\n\r\nBut it added that \"the government will nevertheless keep this area of law under review to ensure that the UK patent system supports AI innovation and the use of AI in the UK\".\r\n\r\nRajvinder Jagdev, of specialist intellectual property litigation firm Powell Gilbert, said: \"The judgement does not preclude a person using an AI to devise an invention - in such a scenario, it would be possible to apply for a patent, provided that person is identified as the inventor. The judgement alludes that had this been the scenario it had been asked to consider, the outcome may have been different.\"\r\n\r\nLegitimate questions\r\nDr Thaler also argued that he was entitled to patents for Dabus inventions as the AI\'s owner, but this was rejected.\r\n\r\nA different decision could have caused \"headaches for companies using [AI] software to innovate as they may not be the owner of the patent\", Diego Black, from European intellectual property firm Withers and Rogers, told the BBC.\r\n\r\nSimon Barker, of law firm Freeths, said the judgement raised \"interesting policy questions\" about how governments might look to change laws in the future as AI advances.\r\n\r\n\"There are similar debates in other areas of intellectual property rights too. Copyright in AI-generated works, for example. Is the programmer of the AI the creator, or the user who is responsible for prompting the machine? And what if it really is just the machine itself, like Dr Thaler claimed of Dabus?\"\r\n\r\nBut Professor Ryan Abbott of the University of Surrey who represented Dr Thaler in the case said the decision implied that \"AI, at best, can be a \'highly sophisticated tool\' that can be used by people who invent.\r\n\r\n\"This affects the meaning of an \"inventor\" under UK patent law, and to be an inventor, one need not make the creative leap behind the invention, as had been previously assumed. Accordingly, companies who use AI to develop products will have to say they or their employees are the inventors, even when the humans involved do little else but switch on the computer.\"\r\n\r\nSome legal experts expect pressure for changes to existing laws to grow, as AIs become increasingly capable of autonomously generating novel ideas.\r\n\r\nIn its statement, the IPO said it recognised \"that there are legitimate questions as to how the patent system and indeed intellectual property more broadly should handle [AI] creations\".\r\n\r\nIn June 2022, the UK government published a response to its consultation on AI and intellectual property.\r\n\r\n\"The response concluded that there should be no legal change to UK patent law now, and noted that many share the view that any future change would need to be at an international level. The decision of the Supreme Court does not alter that conclusion,\" the IPO wrote.', 'Dec 23, 2023', '17033482396587080f722f5.jpg', '4', '3', 'Active');
